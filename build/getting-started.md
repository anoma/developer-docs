# Getting Started

A basic Anoma application can be built purely using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and the [Risc0](https://dev.risczero.com/api) toolchain. Please see the following two steps to install the required software components.

## Installing software prerequisites

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Rust

We recommend following [this Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Make sure you check your Rust installation by running `rustc --version` in your console.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Risc0 toolchain

We recommend following [this Risc0 toolchain installation guide](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install).

Make sure you check your Risc0 toolchain installation by running `rzup --version` in your console.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Having installed both Rust and the Risc0 toolchain, you can start building [your-first-anoma-application](your-first-anoma-application/ "mention").
