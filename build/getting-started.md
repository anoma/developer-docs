# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

In order to get started, you need Clang / LLVM version 13 or later.

On macOS the preinstalled clang does not support the wasm target. Get started by using:

```bash
brew install llvm
```

## Install Juvix

Use the following commands to install Juvix using Homebrew (macOS).

To install the homebrew-juvix tap:

```bash
brew tap anoma/juvix
```

To install Juvix:

```bash
brew install juvix
```

You can also install Juvix from binaries or from source, as detailed on the [Install Juvix](../further-resources/advanced/juvix/install-juvix.md) page.

## Juvix IDEs and plugins

Using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), install Juvix automatically with the [Juvix VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heliax.juvix-mode).
