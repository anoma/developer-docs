# Overview

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Anoma Developer Documentation is currently under active development! Content might change as we're documenting the latest architectural changes of Anoma Beta and their impact on application development.

Anoma is the decentralized OS powering a unified app layer for all Web3. With Anoma, developers can write one app that works on any chain. Anoma frees developers from the complexity of infrastructure so they can focus on what matters: building apps and experiences that people love. Anoma introduces a next-gen intent-centric architecture optimized for app development and UX, enabling Web3 to support a rich ecosystem of apps that can finally compete with the functionality and experience of Web2.

## What's the TL;DR?

* **Anoma is not another L1** bringing incremental improvements to the existing paradigm. It’s a complete conceptual shift in how blockchains are designed and how applications are built, abstracting away the complexities of infrastructure for developers and users.\

* **Anoma is the 3rd generation of blockchain architecture.** Its freeform design brings maximum flexibility: it decouples apps from infrastructure and can take many forms and adapt dynamically to meet changing needs and economic conditions. This is in contrast to conventional blockchains and virtual machines that are rigid and inflexible, creating unnecessary constraints and trade-offs for applications that are holding Web3 back from replacing Web2.\

* **Build apps, not chains**: Anoma is uniquely suited to host Web3’s **application layer**. It’s a decentralized OS that unites all of Web3 into a single development environment. Developers can build one app that can roam seamlessly across any L1 or L2, depending on where the user has state. They no longer need to worry about infrastructure complexities or platform lock-in. This is equivalent to what Windows did to unify the PC environment and abstract hardware complexity from users and developers.\

* Anoma unlocks a **declarative, intent-centric programming** paradigm for Web3 (similar to the shift from JQuery to React that enabled Web2 to fully mature), for unparalleled developer and user experience, efficiency, and expressivity.\

* Anoma introduces several **new capabilities** to blockchain applications, including a groundbreaking app-centric approach to state management that decouples applications from the underlying infrastructure, and a plug-and-play solver network enabling automated and multiparty experiences. These capabilities were previously impossible in Web3 and will help the space reach its full potential.
