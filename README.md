# Overview

Anoma is a **distributed operating system** for building intent-centric applications. It unifies underlying blockchains into a single development environment, ending the fragmentation of state and users that limits today’s decentralized applications. By enabling generalized intents across the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond, Anoma makes a more user-friendly, app-centric future possible for Web3.

## The next generation of dApps is intent-centric.

Anoma introduces a new way to build decentralized applications based not on VM transactions but on intents: the outcomes users want to achieve. This greatly simplifies the user and developer experience, and enables a new era of fully expressive, truly scalable dApps.

## Build with intention.

Focus on your app and outsource the complexity of multichain infrastructure to Anoma. Build once and access users, state, and settlement on any underlying chain with a single deployment.

* **User-centric**\
  Build apps that better serve your users. Put your users in control by allowing them to clearly state their preferences, abstracting away the complexities of underlying infrastructure, and creating more human-friendly interfaces.
* **Unified & composable**\
  Write one app that just works everywhere. Connect to existing liquidity and users on any underlying chain. Anoma defragments the multichain ecosystem, enables intent-level composability, and eliminates the headache of navigating different chains.&#x20;
* **Plug-and-play**\
  Get maximum flexibility with generalized intents and eliminate the need for any additional specialized components or infrastructure. Get to market faster and reduce maintenance overhead with plug-and-play counterparty discovery, solving, and settlement.
* **Scale-free**\
  Scalability is no longer a constraint. Anoma introduces a novel, scale-free approach to scalability, eliminating the need to do everything on chain. Leverage distributed data and compute for the ultimate scalability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. Anoma apps can scale as much as the laws of physics allow.
* **Programmable data sovereignty**\
  Control what data is shared with whom and for what purposes, and empower your users with full sovereignty over their own data.

## Intent-Centric Dapps

Anoma enables not just better apps, but new types of apps. Generalized intents bring full expressivity to the world of decentralized applications, so you can build arbitrary applications that don’t feel like the typical blockchain UX.

#### Example Anoma Applications

* Fully decentralized order book exchanges
* Fully decentralized Slack/Discord&#x20;
* Fully decentralized app-specific rollups&#x20;
* Matchmaking apps (Decentralized Tinder for X)
* Novel crowdfunding mechanisms (Public Signal)
