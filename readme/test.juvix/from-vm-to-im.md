# From VM to IM

Anoma’s intent machine adds powerful functionality to the EVM, enabling fully expressive apps that are decentralized across the entire stack.&#x20;

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p><strong>Transaction-centric</strong></p><p>Users must specify specific execution traces, adding unnecessary complexity.</p>                                   | <p><strong>Intent-centric</strong></p><p>Users only need to specify their desired outcome, significantly improving UX.</p>                                                      |
| <p><strong>On-chain data &#x26; compute</strong></p><p>Expensive and inefficient on-chain data &#x26; compute limits scalability and increases costs.</p>        | <p><strong>Distributed data &#x26; compute</strong><br>Data and compute lives on edge devices with on-chain verification. Costs stay low even as usage scales. </p>             |
| <p><strong>Infrastructure lock-in</strong></p><p>Apps are locked-in to their specific deployment chain.</p>                                                      | <p><strong>Application portability</strong></p><p>Apps are fully portable — infrastructure comes to you, wherever you have state.</p>                                           |
| <p><strong>Transaction-level composability</strong></p><p>Composability is limited to transactions, and breaks down when multichain operations are required.</p> | <p><strong>Intent-level composability</strong></p><p>Intents are fully composable across any chain or application, defragmenting multichain intent liquidity.</p>               |
| <p><strong>Limited data protection</strong></p><p>Global, immutable shared state limits the ability to protect user data.</p>                                    | <p><strong>Programmable data sovereignty</strong></p><p>You and your users have precise control over what data is shared with whom.</p>                                         |
| <p><strong>Centralized counterparty discovery</strong></p><p>Intent-centric apps on VMs need to rely on centralized servers or build everything on-chain.</p>    | <p><strong>Decentralized counterparty discovery</strong></p><p>Intents are matched and solved in a fully-decentralized way, regardless of which chain or app users are on. </p> |
| <p><strong>Limited applications</strong></p><p>Intents in the VM model are application specific, anything more complex requires centralized components.</p>      | <p><strong>Build anything</strong></p><p>You can build any application, including applications that cannot be built on VMs without adding centralization points.</p>            |
