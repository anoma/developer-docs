# Intent-Centric Dapps

Anoma enables not just better apps, but new types of apps. Generalized intents bring full expressivity to the world of decentralized applications, so you can build arbitrary applications that donâ€™t feel like the typical blockchain UX.

## **Example Anoma Apps**

* Fully decentralized order book exchanges
* Fully decentralized Slack/Discord&#x20;
* Fully decentralized app-specific rollups&#x20;
* Matchmaking apps (Decentralized Tinder for X)
* Novel crowdfunding mechanisms (Public Signal)
