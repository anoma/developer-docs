# Overview

In this section, we explain the concepts that you need to write Anoma applications. After a brief introduction to [Anoma's unique state model](../anomas-state-model/) and the [Anoma resource machine](../page/), we explain [resources](../resources/), [transactions](../transactions/) (including what [actions](../transactions/actions.md) and [intents](../transactions/intents.md) are), the different [application components](../applications/), and [services](../services/).
