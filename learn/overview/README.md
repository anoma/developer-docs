# Overview

In this part of the documentation, we explain the concepts being required for writing an Anoma application.

After a brief introduction to [Anoma's unique state model](../anomas-state-model/), we explain the concepts of [resources](../resources/), [transactions](../transactions/) (including what [actions](../transactions/actions.md) and [intents](../transactions/intents-and-solving.md) are), and the [Anoma resource machine](../page/).
