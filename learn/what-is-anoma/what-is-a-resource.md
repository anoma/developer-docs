# What is a resource?

A _resource_ is an atomic unit of state. Resources are similar to [unspent transaction outputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent\_transaction\_output), but much more versatile. In particular, each resource carries a generic resource logic, which describes the ways in which the resource may be used.
