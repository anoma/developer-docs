# What is a transaction?

A transaction object is data that enables a state update that is acceptable according to the [Anoma resource machine](https://anoma.net/research/rise-of-the-resource-machines); each state update amounts to execution of one or several transaction objects. While it is possible to directly create and submit transaction objects to an Anoma instance, the main idea to consider Anoma as an intent-machine is that transactions are composed of user intents. One way in which intents are turned into transactions is in the context of Anoma applications.
