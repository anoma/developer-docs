# What is an intent?

An _intent_ is a machine-readable message concerning user preferences about state. Thus, users can send intents to spread information about how they would like to change (certain aspects of) the "world". The "world" of an application is the application's _state._

Note that

> intents only care about the “what” and don’t care about the “how.”
